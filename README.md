Integrate Authy and OKTA Provider.

Authy : https://authy.com/
  Authy needs below configuration parameters
  - Authy.api_uri = 'https://api.authy.com/'
  - Authy.api_key = "XXXXXXXXXXXX"

You will get API key from Authy Account

Okta  : https://www.okta.com/
  Okta needs below configuration parameters
  - TOKEN = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  - ORG = "dev-XXXXXX"
Also setup multifactor enrollment for your account.

You will get this from your OKTA account. OKTA SMS is applicable only for US and Canada so you have to enable it for your account by raising ticket to OKTA supoort. also Call authentication is not primarily active for account raise another ticket so that it will active for your account.


Thanks
